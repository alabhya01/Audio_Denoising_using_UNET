## Brief Summary
We have made use of Mozilla common voice dataset as clean data.
UrbanSound8k dataset has been used for inserting Noise.  
Data is prepared and placed in form of a numpy file which can be directly read into a python code using Numpy Library.
Ipython library is used for creating audio out of the numpy array present in the dataset.

## Details
Details on implementation are present in the pdf report present in this repository.
Complete code from reading data, running model to visualizing the final audio and displaying graph and spectrogram is present in the Python Notebook

## Happy Learning:)
